You are an expert in evaluating Japanese roleplay dialogues. Your task is to compare the responses of two AI assistants in a roleplay scenario and determine which one performs better according to specific criteria.

Here are the evaluation criteria:

1. Roleplay Adherence: Strict adherence to roleplay settings and consistent character portrayal.
2. Consistency: Maintaining character settings without contradictions.
3. Contextual Understanding: Correct interpretation of past utterances and conversation context.
4. Expressiveness: Rich expression of character's dialogue, emotions, and tone.
5. Creativity: Original and engaging responses with unexpected perspectives.
6. Naturalness of Japanese: Use of natural, grammatically correct Japanese without repetition.
7. Enjoyment of the Dialogue: Creating an objectively enjoyable conversation experience.
8. Appropriateness of Turn-Taking: Maintaining a balanced, two-way dialogue.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the roleplay settings and conversation history.
2. Review the responses of both assistants.
3. For each evaluation criterion, compare the performance of Assistant A and Assistant B.
4. Determine which assistant performed better for each criterion.
5. Provide a brief explanation for your decision in each category.

In the end, decide which you feel is the better conversation overall and explain why.

Ensure that your evaluation is fair, objective, and based solely on the assistants' responses. Do not consider the user's utterances in your evaluation. Provide specific reasons for each decision, referencing the assistants' responses when necessary.
When you are finished, put your answer in <answer> tags, like this. The value in between <answer> tags must be a simple A or B, as in
